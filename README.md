My game is a first-person shooter wave defense game. set in a randomly generated city. The player will have to defend themselves from waves of enemies that will attempt to kill the player. Unlike other wave-based games my game will feature time dilation where time will only move when the player is moving like the game superhot. The game will be set in a cyberpunk style.

The way I intend to create the city generation is by using Perlin noise to decide the height of the buildings making sure each no two buildings are the same height. I will also using create the buildings using segments so each building will look different. The city generation will spawn a grid which will then spawn a smaller grid that will spawn the buildings themselves creating a city block
